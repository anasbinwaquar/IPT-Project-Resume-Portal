# 📝 Resume Grading System 🚀

This project is a **Resume Grading System** that evaluates resumes using an **SVM (Support Vector Machine) Machine Learning Model**. The system includes:

- 🌐 **Flask Server**: Hosts the trained **SVM model** to predict and grade resumes.  
- 💻 **Desktop Application**: Built with **C#**, providing an easy-to-use interface for users.  
- 🖥️ **Web Application**: Developed using **JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**, allowing users to upload and evaluate resumes online.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  

- 🤖 **Machine Learning**: Support Vector Machine (SVM) for resume evaluation.  
- 🐍 **Backend**: Flask (Python) to serve the ML model.  
- 🎨 **Frontend**: JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for the website.  
- 🖥️ **Desktop App**: Developed in C# using .NET  
- 📓 **Jupyter Notebook**: Used for training and testing the SVM model.  

## ✨ Features
