NOTE:   You have to run only the code.py file as this is the main application, training.ipynb
   	Jupeter notebook file is used to train the model and model are saved as 
   	svm_trained_model and Logistic_trained_model which are used in the code.py file.



1. The training named file is a jupeter notebook file, this file is used to train our
   model using the dataset "UpdatedResumeDataSet.csv".

2. For training our model we have used SVM classifier and Logistic Regression.But have
   used the SVM classifier model in the project for resume categorizing and Job
   recommendation as it has greater accuracy stated in the report.

3. The file named as code.py is the main file which have the graphical user interface for
   categorizing all the resume in the corpus and selecting job description to suggest
   top 10 relevant resumes base on the job description.

4. The folder named as "Resume" is the corpus containing 50 resume in .txt format.

5. The folder named as "original_resume" are the resume in .pdf format.

6. The resume in "original_resume" folder are the same resume as corpus they are just in
   the original form.

7. We have saved the resume in .txt format just to use them in the code as the .txt
   format load fast and thus code run fast.

8. Job description folder containes all job description.

9. code.py takes around 30 seconds to start the program as it is pre-processing the resumes.

10. "Reseach Paper" contains the research paper we implemented.
